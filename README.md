### This program reads a text file and counts how many times a character is used in the text file


*for example:*
we have a text file called **text.txt**

text.txt:

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.

the program outputs:

    b  ->  5 
    e  ->  14
    a  ->  6 
    u  ->  3 
    t  ->  16
    i  ->  12
    f  ->  1 
    l  ->  8 
    s  ->  5 
    r  ->  4 
    h  ->  4 
    n  ->  4 
    g  ->  1 
    y  ->  1 
    x  ->  3 
    p  ->  6 
    c  ->  6 
    m  ->  5 
    o  ->  3
